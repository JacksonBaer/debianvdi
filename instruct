This should be done from the client itself as opposed to the SSH session for ease of use

cd debianvdi/
chmod +x setupvdi.sh autostartxde.sh
sed -i 's/\r$//' setupvdi.sh
sed -i 's/\r$//' autostartlxde.sh

sudo ./setupvdi

Enter proxmox ip
Enter Proxmox Vdi Title

cat license.txt
copy contents to clipboard

python3 PVE-VDIClient/vdiclient.py

paste in key and vdi client should open 

sudo autostartlxde.sh
